# My Porfolio Website
Hi! This is my portfolio website, [check it out here!](https://www.matzelle.co/) I try to update it whenever I somewhat complete a new project, or my interests change. I coded this before I knew typescript + tailwind so it's messy pls don't judge 🙏

### Instructions:

1. npm i
2. npm start
