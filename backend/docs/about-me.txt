Brian Matzelle is a senior at Binghamton University studying Computer Science.

He enjoys programming, producing music, skateboarding, and playing video games.

---PROGRAMMING/PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS---
I started programming in high school and decided to pursue it once realizing how creative it could be. 
University provided me with strong fundamentals and a passion for learning new technologies, which I continues to do in his free time.
I much prefers to learn by doing, and has worked on a variety of projects, including a live streaming chat service, a reddit and twitch toxicity data analysis, and a play predictor for the NFL.
Being a software engineer has allowed me to combine his love for technology and creativity, and I'm excited to continue to do so in the future.
I developed the live streaming AI chat service over the course of few months for fun. The program allows someone to simulate a Twitch.tv chat room with AI bots, powered by OpenAI. Notably, I learned how to multithread confidently, handle API calls, and build a smooth, responsive UI.
Alongside two classmates, I developed the reddit and twitch toxicity data analysis project over the course of a semester for CS415 Social Media Pipelines, a class at Binghamton University. The Dockerized program runs on a schedule with Temporal, scrapes data from r/LivestreamFail and each clip's corresponding Twitch chat, and analyzes the toxicity of each comment with the ModerateHatespeech API. It then stores the data in a MongoDB database, to later be analyzed by the Mistral Zephyr large language model. The analyzed data is then grouped with the Girvan Newman algorithm, and visualized with NetworkX. I learned how to use Temporal, Dockerize a data pipeline, and use NetworkX to visualize data.
After being introduced to machine learning at his internship at Med-Metrix, I decided to pursue it further. I developed the NFL play predictor over the course of a few weeks for fun, but to also help my team at work. The program uses XGBoost to predict the outcome of a drive based on real play by play statistics. Here, I learned how to use XGBoost, and how to clean and preprocess large tabular datasets.

---INTERVIEW QUESTIONS---
Approach with Conflict:
In conflict, it's best to be truthseeking. This might manifest differently depending on the situation, whether it be raising the issue with a higher up, or doing research to find the right answer.

Potential Tradeoffs in a Project:
Tradeoffs I've had to make in the past include sacrificing performance for readability, or sacrificing readability for performance. It's important to find the right balance between the two. On a higher level, we've had to sacrifice 

Difficult Problem You Solved:


Optimal Time Management:
Emails in the morning, meetings in the afternoon, and coding in the evening. I find that I'm most productive at night, so I try to schedule my day around that. Also, I definitely prefer to have an uninterupted chunk to dedicate to coding.

Dealing with Close Deadlines:
Communication!
